Pong with emscripten
This Pong game is ported to WSDL by emsdk to run in the browser.
The oiginal code is from the repository:
https://github.com/chaficnajjar/21st-century-pong.git
The code has been modified to be used for geocaching. It shows the north coordinate, if the game has been lost
and the east coordinate, if the game has been won.
